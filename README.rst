Ethical Committee web application in Django

Introduction
------------

This Django_ project allows a user to apply a research project for ethical review.
It was custom-tailored for the `Faculty Ethics Committee - Humanities`_ (FEtC-H) of `Utrecht University`_.

Documentation
-------------

(Somewhat) detailed HTML documentation can be found in the ``docs`` folder.
A HTML version of the docs can be generated by sphinx, and a prebuild version is located in the ``docs/_build/html``
folder.

As a hasty programmer sometimes forgets things, it's recommended you rebuild the documentation yourself once in a while.
You can do this by exectuting the following commands in the ``docs`` folder::

    make clean # autodoc gets confused if you don't clean the existing folder
    make html

You can make any Sphinx supported format you want of course. Just replace the ``html`` with the desired format.

Language
--------

The main language of this web application is Dutch, as it's aimed towards the mostly avid Dutch-speaking researchers of Utrecht University.
However, since October 2016, there is a full English translation available, compiled by `Anna Asbury`_.
Translations in other languages are welcome, of course.
