## Note on Intervention studies

In the summer of 2018 the ETCL (before it became the FEtC-H) requested a number of changes to the intervention form. 

To preserve backwards compatibilty, a version field was added to the intervention model. This version field should be 
automatically updated to the new version on every edit, it's mainly to ensure old already sent in proposals will still 
function properly.
