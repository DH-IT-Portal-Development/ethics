The main language of this web application is Dutch, as it's aimed towards the mostly avid Dutch-speaking researchers of Utrecht University.
However, since October 2016, there is a full English translation available, compiled by `Anna Asbury`_.
Translations in other languages are welcome, of course.
Translations can be easily created using `python manage.py makemessages` and edited using e.g. `Poedit`_.
