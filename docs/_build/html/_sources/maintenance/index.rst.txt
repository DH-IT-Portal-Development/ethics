Maintenance & administration
############################

This section details some common maintenance and administration topics, like updating dependencies and user accounts.
It's written in the point of view of the current configuration, in contrast to the development section which is written
in a more neutral manner.

Periodic tasks
==============

Updating dependencies
---------------------

The dependencies used by the applications become outdated (and insecure) and should be updated semi-often.

Luckily, updating dependencies is very easy:

1. Run the following command:

   .. code:: shell

      pip-compile -U

   This should update the ``requirements.txt`` with the latest versions. If it doesn't, you can copy paste the terminal
   output into ``requirements.txt``

2. Test if everything is still working

3. Deploy the update on the servers

.. warning::

    You should use this guide for Django patch updates only. For feature updates (2.0 to 2.1 for example), see the next
    section.

Updating Django
---------------

Once in a while Django puts out a big update. At the moment we are using Django 1.11 LTS, which should be supported till
April 2020. However, one might decide to update to the latest feature update, or to the next LTS version. In that case,
you can use the following global steps as a guide.

1. Update Django's version constraints in ``requirements.in`` to next version in the series.

2. Go through Django's migration guide for that version and apply necessary changes

3. Test your changes

4. If everything works, go back to step 1 until you have reached the desired version.

5. Check if the application uses deprecated functions and try to migrate to the replacements (saves you or someone else
   a lot of time later).

Sporadic tasks / Frequently encountered problems
================================================

Reverting the status of a concluded review
------------------------------------------

Once all reviewers have made their decision, the review is automatically closed and send along for the next step.
However, some reviewers change their minds after a night's sleep, necessitating a rollback to the review step.

.. warning::

    A supervisor review **should not** be rolled back, doing so will have no effect. The portal automatically creates a
    new committee review once the supervisor review has ended, which will make the portal ignore the supervisor review.

To do this, you need to change 2 models, in the listed order: (This can be done with both Django Admin and Django Shell)

**Decision:**

1. Find the decision model object for the reviewer that want's a rollback
2. Change 'Decision' to '---------' (Or 'None' when doing it from the shell).
3. Empty the 'Date decision' field
4. Save
5. Repeat for other decisions if necessary

**Review:**

1. Find the review model you need (tip: if you are in the Django Admin, you can press 'edit' next to the review field
   of the decision.)
2. Set 'Stage' to 'Assessment by committee'
3. Set 'Decision' to 'Unknown'
4. Empty the 'Date end' field
5. Save

Congrats, you're done!


Adding new users
----------------

There are two kinds of users in the portal: local accounts, which only exist in the application and LDAP (Solis)
accounts, which exist mainly in the LDAP. (Certain attributes are stored in the application and are updated on every
login).

Local accounts will always work, even if the LDAP is unavailable. Note: local accounts should only be used on
acceptation or in emergencies, as the UU likes to have central control over accounts.

Adding local accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Browse to the admin page, and click 'add' next to 'users'.

Note: If you accidentally created a local account when a LDAP account was needed, you can follow the steps in 'Manually
adding LDAP (Solis) accounts'. The local account will automatically be updated to a LDAP account.

Automatic LDAP (Solis) account creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user does not yet exist in the application, an account will be created automatically upon successful
authentication. This requires no action on our side.

Manually adding LDAP (Solis) accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it's not convenient to wait for the automatic creation of LDAP accounts, as this requires the end-user to do
something. This isn't always ideal, for example when a request for a new Committee or Secretary account comes in. In
that case, follow these steps to manually create an account:

- SSH into the server
- Switch to either www-data or root user
- Navigate to installation directory (Probably in ``/hum/web/[HOSTNAME]/data``)
- Activate the virtualenvironment (:code:`source env/bin/activate`)
- Navigate to the 'source' folder
- Run :code:`python manage.py add_ldap_users [SOLIS-ID]`

Setting a new secretary
-----------------------

Sometimes a different secretary needs to be set. This is done by going to the admin interface -> Users.
Find the desired user, and add them to the secretary group. Then, find the old secretary and remove him/her from the
secretary group.

.. warning::

    There should only be one(!) secretary at any time! The application isn't designed to handle more than one, and will
    pick the first one it finds. (This cannot be predicted as it's dictated by the SQL server, which isn't transparent
    about it's default ordering).

New user cannot log in
----------------------

Only users in the HUM-LDAP can log into the system. If a user reports they cannot log in, check if they are in the LDAP.

You can quickly do this with:

.. code:: shell

    python manage.py add_ldap_users SOLISID

If this errors, the user is not in the LDAP.
Otherwise, an account will be created/updated for that user. (Which confirms that they can in fact login).


Fixing proposals
----------------

Sometimes an update can cause some problems with draft proposals. To fix these, one might go into the database itself,
but this is hard. A better way is to do this through the Django shell.

Simply run the following command to start a shell:

.. code:: shell

    python manage.py shell

You can then import the model classes and modify them.

In the following simple example, we are going to create a Documents object for a study that is missing one

.. code:: python

    >> from proposals.models import Proposal
    >> from studies.models import Documents
    >> proposal = Proposal.object.get(pk=42)
    >> study = proposal.study_set.all()[0]
    >> documents = Documents()
    >> documents.proposal = proposal
    >> documents.study = study
    >> documents.save()

.. tip::
    Install bpython if it isn't installed yet. It will give you autocompletion in the shell, and more!
