Introduction

Welcome to the FEtC-H's documentation! This Django_ project allows a user to apply a research project for ethical review.
It was custom-tailored for the `Faculty Ethics Committee - Humanities`_ (FEtC-H) of `Utrecht University`_.

This documentation is meant to give (new) maintainers/developers of the codebase a general overview of the project and
to document procedure.

For reference, a code reference is also included. This reference is auto-generated using the docstrings in the code.
(And with some fancy tricks Django Model metadata is also used.)
